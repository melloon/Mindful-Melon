## 🍉 Mindful Melon

Mindful Melon is a Chrome extension that helps you stay focused while caring for your virtual melon pet.
Your melon stays healthy when you study and avoid blacklisted sites — slack off, and it starts to fade.

### ✨ Features

Pomodoro-style study timer
Lo-fi music for calm focus
Virtual melon pet you can wash, pet, and care for
Blacklist system that reacts to your browsing habits

### ⚙️ How It Works

The extension runs locally and checks your browsing activity.
When you’re studying or using focus mode, your melon stays well.
Visiting sites on your blacklist affects its mood and health.
You can use the Pomodoro timer to track study intervals and rest breaks.
